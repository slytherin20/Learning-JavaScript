//If there are many objects having same repetitive function inside them then it is quite troublesome.Therefore
// we use factory function.
//A factory function is any function which is not a class or constructor that returns a (presumably new) object.
// In JavaScript, any function can return an object. When it does so without the new keyword, itâ€™s a factory function.
//Factory functions uses camel case fr fucntion names
